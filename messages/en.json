            "question": "What is a QR code?",
            "answer": "A QR (Quick Response) code is a 2D barcode that stores information in a square grid. When scanned with a smartphone camera, it instantly displays the encoded content like URLs, text, or contact info."
          },
          "howWork": {
            "question": "How does this QR generator work?",
            "answer": "Simply enter your content (URL, text, WiFi details, etc.), customize colors and size if desired, and the QR code is generated instantly in your browser — no server required."

          "isFree": {
            "question": "Is this QR code generator free?",

          "safe": {
            "question": "Are QR codes safe to scan?",
            "answer": "QR codes themselves are safe. However, always verify the destination before entering sensitive information. Our generator creates standard QR codes that work with any scanner."
          },
          "expire": {
            "question": "Do QR codes expire?",
            "answer": "Static QR codes (like those generated here) never expire — they encode the data directly. However, if the content changes (like a URL destination), you'll need to generate a new QR code."
          },
          "scan": {
            "question": "How do I scan a QR code?",
            "answer": "Most modern smartphones can scan QR codes with the built-in camera app. Just point your camera at the code and tap the notification that appears."

          "formats": {
            "question": "What's the difference between PNG and SVG?",
            "answer": "PNG is a raster image format (pixels), great for web use. SVG is a vector format (math-based), perfect for print as it scales to any size without quality loss."

          "errorCorrection": {
            "question": "What is error correction?",
            "answer": "Error correction allows QR codes to still work even if partially damaged. Higher levels (Q, H) add more redundancy but make the code larger. Use H for logos or harsh environments."
